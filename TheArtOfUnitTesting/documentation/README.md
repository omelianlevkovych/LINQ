# Introduction 
This solution is purely for learning purpose so a lot of messy code and horrible style will be used to save time (there are so many things to learn during this life).
I strongly recommend you not to review the code, if you are in bad mood :)

## LearningNotes
Test name with 'Should' word can be also renamed to:
 - 'ByDefault', in case some action has such invocation process without any changes after inicialization
 - 'WhenCalled', Always, I find it very similar to previously used 'Should' word


# Inspiration
Inspired during reading The Art of Unit Testing book by Osherove, Roy.
